# Postmortem: Service Outage on Perfume Paradise

## Issue Summary
**Duration of the Outage**:  
- Start Time: March 1, 2025, 14:00 UTC  
- End Time: March 1, 2025, 15:30 UTC  
- Total Duration: 1 hour 30 minutes  

**Impact**:  
- The Perfume Paradise website was completely down during the outage.  
- Users experienced 503 Service Unavailable errors when attempting to access the site.  
- Approximately 75% of our users were affected, resulting in significant revenue loss due to lost sales during peak hours.

**Root Cause**:  
The outage was caused by a database overload due to an unexpected surge in traffic combined with inadequate scaling configurations.

## Timeline
- **14:00 UTC**: Issue detected; users began reporting service unavailability.
- **14:05 UTC**: Monitoring alerts indicated increased response times and eventually downtime.
- **14:10 UTC**: Initial investigation focused on server health; no hardware failures detected.
- **14:20 UTC**: Assumption was made that the issue might be related to the web server; logs were checked.
- **14:30 UTC**: Escalated to the DevOps team after further investigation pointed towards database performance.
- **14:45 UTC**: Database metrics were reviewed, confirming high CPU usage and connection limits being reached.
- **15:00 UTC**: Implemented emergency measures to restart the database server.
- **15:30 UTC**: Service restored; site became fully operational.

## Root Cause and Resolution
**Root Cause**:  
The primary cause of the outage was an unexpected spike in user traffic due to a marketing campaign launch. The database was not configured to handle the increased load, leading to high CPU usage and connection timeouts. The existing connection pool was too small, causing new connections to be rejected.

**Resolution**:  
To mitigate the issue, we increased the connection pool size in the database configuration and optimized several slow-running queries identified in the logs. Additionally, we restarted the database server to clear any existing locks and free up resources. Finally, we temporarily scaled up the database instance to handle the increased load.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
**Improvements Needed**:  
- Enhance database scaling configurations to automatically adjust to traffic spikes.
- Optimize database queries for better performance.
- Implement more robust load testing before marketing campaigns.

**Specific Tasks**:
1. **Patch Database Configuration**: Increase connection pool size and set up auto-scaling.
2. **Optimize Queries**: Review and optimize slow queries identified during the incident.
3. **Enhance Monitoring**: Implement detailed monitoring for database performance metrics (CPU, memory, connections).
4. **Load Testing**: Create a load testing plan for future marketing campaigns to ensure database stability.
5. **Post-Incident Review**: Schedule a meeting with the development team to discuss lessons learned and further improvements.
